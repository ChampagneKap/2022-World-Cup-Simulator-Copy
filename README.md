# 2022-World-Cup-Simulator
This is a Java-based simulator for the 2022 World Cup, which I developed as part of my individual uni project.

This folder includes all of my source code for my application.

In order to launch this application, you need to have:
- Java language on your device
- a valid Internet connection

You can execute this application by:
- loading the folder into any Java IDE (such as Eclipse) and executing through there
- or through your console:
   - by compiling all the ".java" files using the command "javac WCSimulatorGUI.java"
   - and executing the ".class" file using the command "java WCSimulatorGUI"

I hope you enjoy my project, and feel free to clone this repo if you feel like any improvements could be made!
