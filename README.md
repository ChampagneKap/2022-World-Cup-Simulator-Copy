# 2022-World-Cup-Simulator
This is a Java-based simulator for the 2022 World Cup, which I developed as part of my individual uni project.

In order to launch this application, you need to have:
- Java language on your device
- a valid Internet connection

You can launch this application through an IDE or through your console.

I hope you enjoy my project, and feel free to clone this repo if you feel like any improvements could be made!
